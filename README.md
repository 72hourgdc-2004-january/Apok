    APOKALYPSE
    Made by Anton Nilsson (Sweden,Lindome) = "Yin"
    www.angelfire.com/rpg/FireStorm

    (Made for the 72 hour game-thing competition. So it's made in less
    than 72 hours. "Team Yin" :3)

    >>>Story

    The apocalypse draws close, and the world is in ruins. In this world,
    destroyed by the war between angels and demons, you play as a little
    kid trying to stay alive and not starve.


    >>>Gamemodes:

    Starvematch - The objective of the game is to be the last player left

    Survival - The game ends when someone die, so the objective is to
    keep everyone alive.


    >>>(ah-ha-ha-ha...)Staying alive:

    Your life will constantly drop due to lack of food, so you'll need to
    eat to stay alive. Vampires life drops faster.
    If you walk of the edges of the arena/map/level you'll lose all life.


    >>>Controls:

    P1 - Walk/Jump:Arrows - Pick up/Drop:Num1 - Use/Shot:Num2

    P2 - Walk/Jump:A,W,S,D - Pick up/Drop:C - Use/Shot:V

    P3 - Joystick/Joypad

    P4 - Walk/Jump:H,J,U,K - Pick up/Drop:O - Use/Shot:P

    PICK UP/DROP: Should be easy to understand.

    USE: Means that you use the item your holding (fire a gun, eat food...)

    SHOT: If you do not carry anything, and press the "Use" button you will
    shot a small ball-thing which can push people and make them drop what
    they're carrying. It won't hurt them though. And shooting one of those
    balls uses up some of your life, so be careful. If you're low on life,
    you won't be able to shot.


    >>>Items:

    Apple: Restores 10 Life
    Bread: Restores 20 Life
    Pizza: Restores 30 Life
    Gun: Weapon with 5 shots
    Submachinegun: Just like the gun, but with 20 shots
    Cross: Weapon which can hurt vampires


    >>>Other characters:

    Baker(or whatever): Carries around a bread.
    Vampire: Wants to drink your blood and make you a vampire as well.
    Meanie: Just wants to beat you.
    Vampirehunter: Wants to kill vampires.

    If you shot someone peaceful, they'll be mad and start chasing you.
    They won't be satisfied til they get to hit someone (dosn't have to
    be you though, so try to lure them into hitting the other players
    or antoher npc character).


    >>>Being a vampire:

    When you're a vampire you can't eat normal food. You'll need to drink
    the blood of other characters (human or npc dosn't matter). To do this,
    press the "Use" button while standing next to your victim.
    If the victim is another player, they'll also turn into vampires.


    >>>Days:

    As the days go by, there will be less food and more dangers, thus
    making it harder to stay alive.


    >>>Things I'd like to add later:

    Demons (evil characters showing up around day 6-7)
    Firerain (when the apocalypse is really close)
    Better Sound
    Music

    >>>Legal stuff

    This game is mine. The code and graphics is mine. End of discussion.

    ...

    That's all you need to know, I guess.

    And like Capcom says: "Thank you for playing"
